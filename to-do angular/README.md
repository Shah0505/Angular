# TO-do-angular

Created a simple to-do angular js to showcase the basic conceptes on angular.js with version [1.5.5](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.5/angular.min.js) 

In addition to angular used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) to provide responsiveness to the app
