# TO-do-angular

Created a simple to-do angular js to showcase the basic conceptes on angular.js with version [1.5.5](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.5/angular.min.js) and angular [animate](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.5/angular-animate.min.js) to provide animation effects

In addition to angular used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) to provide responsiveness to the app

You can see the app in action [here](http://codepen.io/shah-0721/full/mAPRgr/)
